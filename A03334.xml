            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:4278:10"/> ſame matter) ſaieth, that blaſphemy againſt the holy Ghoſt ſhall <hi>neuer</hi> be forgiuen <hi>[non in aeternum]</hi> and S. <hi>Matthew</hi> diuideth this ſpace of eternity in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>ſeculum praeſens, &amp; ſeculum futurum,</hi> the world preſent, and the world to come, as being two ſeuerall, and diſtinct parts thereof; ſo that the ſame thing is noted by each Euangeliſt, but <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunctiuely</hi> in the one, and <hi>distributiuely</hi> in the other.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. The Proteſtants deriue this text after an other manner, and ſay, that S. <hi>Matthew</hi> is to be expounded by S. <hi>Marke,</hi> and ſo the intendment of this Scripture is preciſely, and meerely to ſhew, that the <hi>great ſinne</hi> (being irremiſsible in an eminent degree) ſhall neuer be forgiuen.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. But this ſimple gloſſe could yeald me no ſatisfaction. For though it were the purpoſe of our Lord to declare that one ſinne ſhall neuer be forgiuen, yet he expreſſeth himſelf by ſuch a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction, as doth manifeſtly inforce the remiſsion of ſome ſinnes in the future life. And foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muchas S. <hi>Matthew</hi> dealeth more copiouſly herein then S. <hi>Marke,</hi> there is no reaſon why the firſt ſhould be contracted by the ſecond, but rather it is neceſſary to enlardge the ſecond by the firſt.</p>
                           <p n="5">5. Neither did it ſeeme a probable conceit vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me (though it be intertayned by many) that our Sauiour did not make a partition of ſinnes (ſome to be remitted in this world, and ſome in the next) but vſed an exaggeration to ſhew the irremiſsibillity of one ſinne, as if I ſhould ſay, <hi>A barren woman shall not beare a child neither in this world, nor in the world to come:</hi> For though the WORD did ſpeake, <note n="b" place="margin">
                                 <hi>Io.</hi> 7.46.</note> 
                              <hi>as neuer man ſpake</hi> (in reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:4278:10"/> of Maieſty, grauity, and power) yet he doth not ſo decline the accuſtomed manner of ſpeach, as that he would ſpeake againſt the rules of pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency, and morall vnderſtanding; as this ſpeach is, if it be ſenſed in this manner. And who would not eſteeme him to be a ridiculous, and abſurd Oratour that ſhould ſay, <hi>This woman shall not beare a child in this world, neither in the world to come?</hi>

                           <p n="6">6.

<pb n="56" facs="tcp:4278:38"/> by the confeſsion of the <hi>Greekes</hi> themſelues in the <hi>Florentine</hi> Councell; for it appeareth by their publick proteſtation, that they agreed fully with the <hi>Romane</hi> Church in the eſſentiall doctrine hereof; howbeit they diſſented from hir in ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me points, which are not abſolutely pertayning vnto the neceſsity of faith.</p>
                           <p n="5">5. Now concerning ſuch as haue denied this doctrine as well in nature, as in name, in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, as in circumſtance, I noted a great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in the manner, and courſe, and reaſon of their deniall. For ſome denied it <hi>Secondarily,</hi> and by way of inference, that is to ſay, by reaſon of a precedent errour. Thus the <hi>Armenians,</hi> &amp; cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayn <hi>Greekes</hi> haue bene devolued into a fooliſh imagination to conceiue, that the ſoule hath no ſenſe of ioy, nor payn, vntill hir reunion with the body; and hence it followeth neceſſarily, that there is no Purgatory after death. Some haue denied it <hi>Primarily,</hi> and ſimply; that is to ſay, not in regard of any precedent errour infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring this deniall, but directly, and preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſely in regard of the thing it ſelf. Thus onely our <hi>Aërians, Henricians, VValdenſians,</hi> and finally we <hi>Proteſtants</hi> (iſſuing from ſuch Progenitours) haue reiected this doctrine, by a violent ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration of our ſelues from the viſible ſociety of the Church.</p>
                           <p n="6">6. But foraſmuch as theis <hi>Henricians,</hi> and <hi>VVal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſians</hi> (in whom we glory; and Catholicks do not enuy vs this honour) were ſometimes mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, as truly, and really connexed vnto the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, as any other men, and fell away afterward
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:4278:38"/> from their communion (as <hi>VVickliff</hi> alſo did) I intertayned my ſelf a while in this conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; viz. Since there was a time (yea many hundred yeares) when no <hi>VVickleuian,</hi> no <hi>VVal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſian,</hi> or <hi>Henrician</hi> did appeare; who did then deny Purgatory, &amp; who did then oppoſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf againſt this <hi>hereſy,</hi> this <hi>damnable,</hi> and <hi>blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous</hi> doctrine (as we call it) for many genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions? Wherefore as <hi>Tertullian</hi> doth excellently ſay; <q>There was a time when ſuch,<note place="margin">Praeſcript. cap 30.</note> and ſuch hereſies were not knowen; <hi>Vbi tunc Marcion, vbi tunc Valentinianus? &amp;c.</hi> where was <hi>Marcion,</hi> and where was <hi>Valentinian</hi> then? It is manifeſt that they themſelues were ſometime no hereticks, but that they obſerued the Catholick Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion &amp;c.</q> So I ſpake in my ſecrete thoughts, and ſayd; there was a time, when our opinions were not knowen: where was <hi>Henricus,</hi> or <hi>VValdo</hi> then? It is manifeſt that they themſelues were ſometime no impugners of this doctrine, but that they did meekely, and dutifully obſerue it as a part of the true, and Catholick Religion.</p>
                           <p n="7">7. I proceeded yet a little farther, and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, that we Proteſtants could not poſsibly aſsigne ſo much as the ſhaddow of any one man (our <hi>Henricians,</hi> and <hi>VValdenſians</hi> excepted) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying, or doubting of Purgatory, who was not hereticall in ſome other doctrine, euen ſuch, as we our ſelues confeſſe to bring very great, and eminent danger vnto ſaluation. And what ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantadge, or defence could I take from any heretick, to ſecure my ſelf in ſuch a caſe? For if any man did pleaſe me in denying Purgatory,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:4278:39"/> yet he did diſpleaſe me alſo by ſome odious, and hatefull opinion, wherewith he was infected: and then I could not find out any true, and <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick</hi> Church, vnleſſe I would diſtill it my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtically out of ſondry perſons, and compound their ſimples into one body of Religion. Which though it be ſuch an ignoble, and an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly deriuation of the Church, as tendeth vnto the great contempt, and ignominy of Religion, yea the pure ſubuerſion, and annihilation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, yet neceſsity hath inforced vs Proteſtants vnto theis paradoxicall fancies; for thus, &amp; no otherwiſe can we ſuſtayn the eſſence, and exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtency of our Church.</p>
                           <p n="8">8. The concluſion, which yealded it ſelf vnto me out of the former conſideration, was this; Whereas there hath bene no viſible Church, nor member thereof for many hundred yeares, which was not <hi>HERETICALL</hi> in an high degree (as our doctrines do clearely import) it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> followeth, either that the PROVIDENCE of God <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> hath fayled, or that the true Church was inui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> or els that the true viſible Church may err damnably in faith. None but Atheiſts will affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me the firſt: the learnedſt Proteſtants deny the ſecond; Scriptures, and Fathers conuince the third. Wherefore reflecting vpon our accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this doctrine, I ſaw that it was vniuſt: and thus I reſolued by a powerfull demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (iſſuing from the premiſſes) that <hi>Purgatory</hi> is no <hi>hereſy,</hi> nor <hi>Antichristianiſme</hi> (as we pretend with greater violence, then reaſon) but a parcell of the true, ancient, Catholick, and Apoſtolick
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:4278:39"/> faith, as the <hi>Papists</hi> do confidently belieue.</p>

                           <p n="15">15. Wherefore I proceeded vnto a SECOND conſideration, which is more <hi>peculiar,</hi> and which did more forcibly procure my firme reſolution, and indubious aſſent.</p>
                           <p n="16">16. For ſince our Lord did giue his owne teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony

And my reaſon to conceiue thus, was, becauſe as S. <hi>Bernard</hi> deliuered it, and the people accepted it no leſſe freely then any other, ſo likewiſe God himſelf did concurr in the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this miracle for a noble end; viz. the confuſion of hereſy, the manifeſtation of the truth, the honour of his name, the ſafety of his Church, the ſatisfaction of men preſent, and the inſtruction of ſucceeding ages.</p>
                           <p n="17">17. Yea foraſmuch as he that wrought this illuſtrious Miracle, did then, and there (in the voyce, and authority of the <hi>Catholique</hi> Church) publiquely teach, and earneſtly perſwade, and conſtantly defend this doctrine, how ſhall the witt of an Archangell diſtinguiſh, what was, &amp; what was not confirmed by this Miracle, in caſe the glorious Saint, and the viſible Church were erroneous in the <note n="*" place="margin">See befo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re; num. 1.</note> ſaid opinions (as farr as the ſubſtance thereof extendeth itſelf) &amp; principally in the FIRST, it being a chief article in that catalogue?</p>

For if I <hi>accepted</hi> the Fathers, they did conuince me; if I <hi>reiected</hi> them, my folly would be great, and my diſpute vncertayn. And thus I ſaw that the iudgement of <note n="q" place="margin">
                                 <hi>Ret.</hi> 5.</note> 
                              <hi>Edm Campian</hi> muſt neceſſarily take place, viz. <hi>AEternam cauſae maculam coguntur [Protestantes] inurere, ſiue recuſent patres, ſiue depoſcant; nam in altero fugam adornant, in altero ſuffocantur.</hi> Which points I proſecuted yet farther (though briefly) in this manner.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. If I ACCEPT the Fathers to be be my <hi>Iudges,</hi> as they are Churches <hi>VVitneſſes,</hi> I haue the face of all Antiquity confronting me, and ſpeciallly
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:4278:55"/> S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> whom, for ſome iuſt reſpects, I do ſpecially eſteeme. Was he a <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> and a <hi>Papist?</hi> then two different Religions are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patible in one ſoule; whence muſt enſue as great a ſtrife,<note place="margin">Geneſ. 25.22.23.</note> and colluctation, as <hi>Rebecca</hi> felt in hir womb, when <hi>two Nations</hi> contended in hir body. Or was he a <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> and not a <hi>Papiſt?</hi> why then is he ſo perſpicuous againſt me in this matter? Or was he a <hi>Papiſt,</hi> and not a <hi>Protestant?</hi> why then do we ſo triumph, and glory in his name? Or finally; was he neither <hi>Papiſt,</hi> nor <hi>Proteſtant?</hi> Then both theis Religions (in all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability) are falſe, and then (perhapps) none is true. Thus from an vncertainty, men runne into a nullity of faith, and ſo the end of hereſy is <hi>Atheiſme,</hi> becauſe there can be no other iſſue, vnto which it doth finally propend. And ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, who doth not conceiue (vpon due ponde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration) that, if the <hi>CATHOLICK</hi> Religion, being ſo ſpectable in dignity, ſo continued in ſucceſsion, ſo enlardged in diffuſion, and ſo eminent in all reſpects, ſhould notwithſtanding ſeeme falſe, or dubious, by reaſon of ſome cauillations framed againſt it by hir enimies, it will rather come to paſſe, that no Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion ſhould be true, then that the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> faith, which hath ſuch a late entrance, ſuch baſe founders, ſuch vncertayn grounds, ſuch infinite diuiſions, ſhould be more credible, and probable then the ſaid <hi>CATHOLICK</hi> belief?</p>
                           <p n="3">3. I proceed. Since I was ſo powerfully expugned by the Fathers, as you haue ſeene,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:4278:55"/> how could I elude the grauity of their teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, which preſſed, and oppreſſed me on euery ſide? Should I (<hi>Alexander</hi>-like) cutt the knott inſunder with violence, which I could neuer vntye with skill?</p>
                           <p n="4">4. There remayned one principall ſhift for me, but yet it was of no value, or ſubſtance. For though later ages ſpeake more copiouſly in this particular, and in many others, then the former, yet I ſaw, that it was by way of expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, not innouation; of declaration, not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration; of expoſition, not addition &amp;c. For it is an excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t preſcription, which <hi>Lirinenſis</hi> deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth in this caſe; viz. <hi>Fides habet profectum,</hi>

Matters of <hi>Doctrine</hi> haue their inlardgement, and amplification; but yet ſo, as that no <hi>other fundation be layed, then the ſame which we receiued in the beginning.</hi> Thus <hi>Pelagians</hi> may not complayn, if the doctrine of <hi>Grace</hi> were more clearely illuſtrated by <hi>S. Auguſtine,</hi> then euer it was diſcuſſed before. Thus the <hi>Arrians</hi> may not complayn, if the doctrine of <hi>Homouſia</hi> were more fully explicated by the Fathers of <hi>Nice,</hi> then euer it was vnfolded vntill that time. Thus alſo we <hi>Proteſtants</hi> cannot iuſtly complayn, if the Catholick doctrine in this particular, were more abundantly expreſſed by <hi>S.

                           <p n="5">5. In REIECTING the Fathers, and recurrring vnto the Scripture alone, I ſaw that I ſhould ſtriue without ſucceſſe; not becauſe the truth wanteth defence in this kind, but becauſe I feared, leaſt I might ſweare fealty vnto mine owne ſenſe, and dwell therein, as a ſnayle taketh impotent ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary in the ſhell, which hir naturall art hath faſhioned out of hir proper ſtuffe.</p>
                           <p n="6">6. Thus <hi>Iouinian</hi> (a worthy Progenitour of <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi> ghoſpell) did ſo wreſt, and peruert the ſacred writt to eſtabliſh his ſottiſh hereſy concerning the <hi>equallity of Ioyes in Heauen, and Paynes in Hell,</hi> that <note n="ſ" place="margin">Contra <hi>Iouinian.</hi> lib. <hi>2.</hi> paulò poſt med.</note>

                           <p n="7">7. But the deſperate folly of ſuch as renounce the iudgement of the Fathers, and dwell in their owne ſenſe of holy Scripture, diſcouereth it ſelf moſt playnely in the late Founders of our Gho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell.

                           <p n="6">6. I noted farther, that as this Rule is infallible in all points of my faith [a <hi>negative</hi> faith; buylt, for the moſt part, <hi>ex deſtructione veritatis,</hi> as <note n="z" place="margin">Praeſcript. cap. <hi>42.</hi>

                           <p n="7">7. For which reſpect, I promiſed a certayn victory vnto my ſelf, when firſt I ſingled forth this matter to be the ſubiect of my <note n="*" place="margin">With a <hi>Catholick</hi> in <hi>England.</hi>
                              </note> diſpute; relying more vpon the weakeneſſe of mine ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries cauſe, then vpon the confidence of mine owne ſtrength.</p>
                           <p n="8">8. If it be FALSE, then the <hi>contrary</hi> vnto it muſt needs be true. For as there is a Truth in all things (though more difficill, and obſcure in ſome, then in others) ſo it is but one, and ſimple. Yea truth, and falſehood are ſo diametrically
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:4278:58"/> oppoſed (the one <hi>affirmative,</hi> the other <hi>negatiue</hi>) that, where all due circumſtances are obſerued, there a <hi>Contradiction</hi> muſt neceſſarily enſue.</p>
                           <p n="9">9. Here I attempted, as fairely, and ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially, as I could deuiſe, to oppoſe a CONTRARY aſſertion vnto each particular going before.

                           <p n="10">10. Now for the better inſtruction of the good Reader, I will expreſſe my meaning familiarly, by ſome few particulars in this diſcourſe. As for example; Whereas I had deduced the cuſtome of <hi>Prayer for the dead</hi> from the holy Apoſtles [during the time of the ghoſpell; for the <hi>Iewes,</hi> who are moſt ſtrict in the obſeruation of their law, pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe it by an euerlaſting Tradition of their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers] I ſayd, <hi>no;</hi> it came not from the Apoſtles. But how could I iuſtify, and maintayn this
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:4278:58"/> aſſertion; and why ſhould I creditt my priuate opinion, or the iudgement of <hi>Luther,</hi> and his compeeres, againſt the teſtimony of the Fathers, and preſcription of all ages? Or why ſhould I think, that any damnable errour, ſpringing from naturall affection, and imitation of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, could thus inuade the vniuerſall Church, without any reſiſtance?</p>
                           <p n="11">11. Whereas I had inferred <hi>Purgatory</hi> from the perpetuall cuſtome of <hi>Prayer for the dead,</hi> I ſayd, <hi>no;</hi> the Catholick Church had no purpoſe in the commendation of the dead, to free their ſoules from any temporall payn. But how could I defend my conceipt herein againſt the cleare, and irrefragable authority of <note n="*" place="margin">See befo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re pag. 35.</note> S. AVGVSTINE, ISIDORE, CYRILL, &amp; others; whoſe <note n="*" place="margin">It goeth hard, if for <hi>a matter of hiſtory,</hi> the Fathers can find no bet<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter credit (ſaith <hi>D.

                           <p n="12">12. Whereas I had declared, that none but <hi>Hereticks</hi> did reiect this doctrine, I ſayd, <hi>no;</hi> they were not hereticks at all, or els they were not hereticks preciſely in this poynt. But I ſaw that the ſame <hi>Catholick</hi> Church which reputed them [<hi>Aërius</hi> &amp;c.] hereticks in other things, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned them likewiſe in this, and there was no poſsibility for me to defend <hi>Aërius</hi> from the crime of hereſy, but by imputing it vnto S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine, Epiphanius</hi> &amp;c. which were a deſperate attempt.</p>
                           <p n="13">13. In a word. Whereas I had noted the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, and manifold graces, which ſhined in thoſe Fathers, by whom this doctrine was propugned,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:4278:59"/> I could not prooue the contrary. Whereas I had deſcribed the vile, and contemptible eſtate of <hi>Aërius, &amp; Henricus</hi> by whom it was impugned, I could not prooue the contrary. Whereas I had informed my ſelf, how <hi>Henricus</hi> was confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by a ſingular miracle of S. <hi>Bernard,</hi> I could not prooue the contrary; neither could I learn, that he, or <hi>Aërius,</hi> or <hi>Luther,</hi> or <hi>Zwinglius,</hi> or <hi>Caluin</hi> or any other Mint-maiſter of our late ghoſpell, did giue the leaſt reſemblance of any rare, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine work, whereby I might perceiue, that God did concurr with him for the approbation of his new-coyned faith, and warrant of ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate proceedings.</p>

                        <p>THvs being not able to diſprooue my former Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, I was inforced to approoue it, and therefore I muſt neceſſarily perſiſt in this opinion, vntill it be refuted in ſuch manner, as that the CONTRARY alſo vnto it, and euery particular therein (pertayning directly, or indirectly vnto this iſſue) be clearely, and ſubſtantially confirmed.</p>
                        <p>If my reaſons preuayle not with you, yet deſpiſe me not; I am your contreyman, your fleſh, and bloud, tyed vnto you by the ſtrong obligations of nature. Charity compelleth me vnto this act of loue, that I ſhould wiſh you that happineſſe, vnto which we all aſpire; but how ſhall we meete in one end, who inſiſt in ſuch diuerſity of way?</p>
                        <p>Let morall reaſon aſſure you, that I am not tranſported by any light, or ſodayn motion, to ſubmitt my ſelf vnto a Religion, which is neither delightfull vnto carnall affection, nor profitable in theis dayes of mourning. I had my por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of hopes, as well as many others; Fortune beheld me
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:4278:59"/> with a benigne, and comfortable aſpect; and if I could preferr ſuch intanglements before that TRVTH, which crieth mightily in my reynes, I know no reaſon, why I ſhould want that commodity, which I haue bene inuited to enioy.</p>
                        <p>But as I giue moſt humble thanks vnto them, whoſe will to do me earthly pleaſures, hath ſhewed it ſelf no leſſe ready in promiſe, then their place doth inable them vnto the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance, ſo I muſt be bold to ſay, with their permiſſion, that my eſtate (ſince I am conſcious vnto mine owne thoughts, and am reſolued, that neither feare, nor hope ſhall foyle my Religion, by his gratious aſſiſtance, vpon whoſe mercy I depend) would be vncertainly good, or certainly euill, when other mens will to command, ſhould be my reaſon to obay.</p>
                        <p>Finally therefore, let your reciprocall Charity teach you to conceiue, that I would not ſtriue vnwiſely againſt the benefitts of Fortune, or vnkindly againſt the duty of Nature, vnleſſe ſome ſuperiour, and more excellent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, then theis, did obtayn a powerable authority in my ſoule. And as you haue already ſeene one parcell of that <hi>Motiue,</hi> which made an entrance vnto my <hi>Royall Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandge,</hi> ſo, when you haue examined the ſecond, I hope that you will intertayn a gentle cenſure of your poore friend, and that you will not torment his name vpon the rack of vnchriſtian, and exceſſiue ſpeach.</p>

Thirdly, by an <hi>Extenſion;</hi> for whereas S. <hi>Gregory</hi> ſaieth, IVSTORVM, the ſoules of <hi>iuſt</hi> men, he rendreth the ſpeach in a more generall, and vnconfined manner; viz. the ſoules of <hi>men</hi> dying: and thus he mangleth a cleare ſentence, to deriue a concluſion from it,<note place="margin">Many ſuch tricks were diſcouered by the B. of <hi>Eureux</hi> in the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of the L. <hi>Pleſſis.</hi> See <hi>the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the Relation of a triall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in France.</hi> It is annexed to the <hi>Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of Fox his Calen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dar-Saints;</hi> Part. 1. a <hi>Cathol. doctr.</hi> pag. 121.</note> contrary to the purpoſe of the author there, and his doctrine in other places.</p>
                           <p n="6">6. For, if not <hi>all light</hi> ſinnes, but the LEAST; in the ſoules of IVST men, to witt ſuch, as are of ſingular ſanctity (and not generally of <hi>men</hi>

This is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendment of S. <hi>Gregory:</hi> and therefore a <hi>M.

But Bellarmine will reply, <q>that <hi>the custome of praying for the dead was moſt ancient.</hi> We anſwere: <hi>The cuſtome of remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring the departed, naming their names at the holy Table, in the time of the holy myſteries, and offering the Euchariſt (that is, the ſacrifice of prayſe) for them, was a most ancient, and godly cuſtome, neither is it any wayes diſliked by vs.</hi> And <hi>ſurely</hi> it appeareth, <hi>this was the cauſe</hi> that AERIVS was condemned of hereticall raſhneſſe, in that he durſt condemne this lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable, and ancient cuſtome of the commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the dead.</q>

<pb n="136" facs="tcp:4278:79"/> ſame effect, as we do at this day, ſaying; <q>if the prayers of the liuing may be <hi>profitable</hi> vnto the dead, then let a man liue as he li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                           <p n="3">3.

But foraſmuch as I perceiued, that the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour doth wiſely conceale, and prouidently diſſemble the quality, and reaſon of that dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, which our Diuines are chardged with in this matter, I entered into a ſerious conſideration thereof, and obſerued, that it doth ariſe, and flow,<note place="margin">NOTA.</note> not out of their diuers apprehenſion of the thing it ſelf, but out of a different opinion, which they intertayn con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the authority of the Church. Hence it is, that <hi>Luther, Zwinglius,</hi> and ſuch paſsio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate gentlemen, neglecting the triall of their faith, by the teſtimony of Fathers, and plauſibly reducing all things vnto the Scripture (either <hi>ſimply;</hi> by admitting no other proof at all: or <hi>reſpectiuely;</hi> by admitting the Fathers <hi>as farr as
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:4278:86"/> they agree with the Scripture;</hi> and ſo farr they may admitt a triall by the Diuell himſelf, and yeald as much reſpect vnto him, as vnto them) confeſſe plainely, and ſyncerely, that <hi>Aërius</hi> did not err in his reprehenſion, but that the Church erred in hir practiſe. On the contrary; other men pretending to deale more fairely with the Church (their mother) and to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues vnder hir protection, will not (forſooth) ſeeke hir ruine, by whom they would ſeeme to ſtand, and therefore they are compelled to frame moſt improper, vayn, and friuolous inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations of this, and other things, to maintayn the goodneſſe of their cauſe, according to the nature of their defence.</p>

                           <p n="2">2. Here is an ample teſtimony of an vnfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full heart.

                           <p n="4">4. But is this a ſufficient reaſon for <hi>M.

                           <p n="2">2. The firſt opinion, concerning <hi>Veniall</hi> ſinnes, he attributeth vnto <hi>S. Gregory,</hi> &amp; termeth him a PAPIST; either forgetting, or not regarding, that our Chriſtian faith deſcended originally from him, and that it was receiued conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly by our State, and that it was protected openly for 930. yeares by our worthy Princes (in the number of whom, many were pious in religion as <hi>Dauid,</hi> wiſe in counſayle as <hi>Salomon,</hi> valiant in warr as <hi>Ioſuah</hi>) in a word, that this faith hath bene glorious in dignity, and fruict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in good workes. And truly theis cogita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions did enter ſo forcibly into my heart, euen while I was a member actually of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtanticall Church, that, in my ſecrete thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghts, I could not but acquitt the <hi>Papists</hi> from the crime of diſobedience, and vndutifulneſſe vnto the State, foraſmuchas they made not the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                           <p n="3">3. As for the particular, wherewith he is chardged by <hi>M. Rogers,</hi> it is no ſhame, nor diſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation vnto him; <note n="*" place="margin">Tom. 10. homil. 16.</note> 
                              <hi>S.

                           <p n="4">4. I come therefore vnto the ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d opinion, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                              <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Mortall</hi> ſinnes, which he aſcribeth vnto <note n="*" place="margin">Poſit. 6.</note> 
                              <hi>Eckius;</hi> as though this famous Antagoniſt of our <hi>great Reformer,</hi> had taught, that <hi>Mortall</hi> ſinnes as well as <hi>Veniall,</hi> are remitted, or expiated after this life. Whence it followeth, that he incurred the ſame fancy,<note place="margin">See before; pag. 121.</note> which (as D. <hi>Field</hi> pretendeth) <hi>S. Augſtine</hi> did fearefully impugne in his time, becauſe it was embraced by <hi>great, and reuerend Authours.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="5">5. But here <hi>M. Rogers</hi> doth abuſe his Authour, and deceiue his Reader. For the poſition of <note n="*" place="margin">See Tom. 1. Luh. Witte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber. fol. 241. b.</note> 
                              <hi>Eckius</hi> is this. <hi>The ſoules in Purgatory do ſatisfy for the paynes of ſinne, from the guilt whereof they were ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued before, and made not ſatisfaction in this life.</hi> So then it is a falſehood in M. <hi>Rogers</hi> to pretend,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:4278:93"/> that, in the opinion of <hi>Eckius,</hi> mortall <hi>ſinnes</hi> are purged, &amp;c. For <hi>Eckius</hi> affirmeth, that the guilt being taken away (&amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſequently the ſinne it ſelf) there remayneth a temporall payn to be inflicted vpon the ſoule. For better illuſtration of which poynt, it may pleaſe thee (gentle Reader) to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue with me, that as by mortall ſinnes, we are obliged vnto a double penalty, to witt <hi>eternall,</hi> &amp; <hi>temporall,</hi> ſo whenſoeuer the guilt is pardoned, the eternall (which is moſt properly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſequent vnto it) is pardoned likewiſe, but not the temporall.

                           <p n="7">7. Thus I found a double reaſon of <hi>Purgatory;</hi> the <hi>FIRST;</hi> becauſe ſome ſmaller ſinnes,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:4278:94"/> (wherewith grace may conſiſt in the ſoule) are there expiated, both in reſpect of <hi>guilt,</hi> and <hi>payn:</hi> the <hi>SECOND;</hi> becauſe ſome temporall payn (reſerued by the juſtice of God, after forgiueneſſe of the guilt by his mercy) is there ſuſtayned by them, who haue not bene exerciſed with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digne pennance in this life. And here ariſeth a proper ſolution vnto the ſubtility of <hi>D. Field,</hi>
                              <note place="margin">See before; pag. 103.</note> who would conclude; that, <hi>if all ſinne be taken away, which is the cauſe, the effect muſt ceaſe, which is punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> &amp;c. For though the obligation vnto eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall puniſhment, ceaſeth actually vpon remiſsion of the guilt, yet the obligation vnto temporall puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t doth remayn by the juſtice of God; &amp; his ordinance concurring with our deſert, is a ſufficient cauſe to produce ſuch effect. Therefore till his juſtice be ſatisfied, the cauſe of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment doth ſtill endure.</p>
                           <p n="8">8. To co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude. Whereas <hi>M.

                              <pb n="167" facs="tcp:4278:94"/> would lead his reader to conceiue, that the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts are ſingularly diuided in their opinions; ſome affirming, that onely <hi>Veniall</hi> ſinnes, others reſoluing, that <hi>Mortall</hi> likewiſe are cleanſed in a penall eſtate.</p>

                        <p>COncerning the Authour, and his work, I will ſay little; it is the iudgement of many principall Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines in Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, that <hi>D.

                        <p>Beſides; as the qualitie of the aduerſary deſerued good reſpect, and the weight of his reaſons required condigne ſatisfaction (which neither himſelf, nor D. <hi>VVhitaker</hi> haue yealded thereunto) ſo it did greatly import him to deale vprightly, &amp; ſubſtantially in his anſwere, foraſmuch as he deſigned two <note n="*" place="margin">Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leigh.

                        <pb facs="tcp:4278:98"/> the competency of the IVDGE, the reſolution of the MATTER.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Concerning the FIRST; it importeth the witneſſe onely to expreſſe, what was the intentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Church in this practiſe. And as <hi>S. Auguſtine is a moſt faithfull witneſſe of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity</hi> (in M. <note n="*" place="margin">Inſt. l. 3. c. 3. §. 10. &amp;c.</note>

                     <p n="2">2. Concerning the SECOND; you ſee that the Churches <hi>inſtruction</hi> touching this matter, was knowen familiarly vnto all the <hi>faithfull:</hi> ſo that you muſt either vnnaturally, and impiouſly (as <hi>Aërian</hi> hereticks) reiect your Mothers inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, or els as dutifull, and obſequious children, you muſt ſubmitt your ſelues vnto hir doctrine.

                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. Concerning the THIRD; you can not but perceiue the clearneſſe thereof expreſſed in this diſtinction; <hi>VVe do not pray for Martyrs:</hi> and, <hi>VVe do pray for other men,</hi> By which manifeſt difference, <hi>S. Augustine</hi> doth ſufficiently declare, that the memory of Martyrs was celebrated at the Altar, by way of <hi>THANSKGIVING,</hi> and gladneſſe: but the names of other men were remembred by way of <hi>PETI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TION,</hi> and deſire. The reaſon whereof ariſeth out of their eſtate. <hi>VVe pray not for a Martyr;</hi> and, <hi>it were an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iury to pray for him:</hi> Why? Becauſe we know that he is in heauen; and to haue any diffidence of his beatitude, it were injurious vnto his cauſe, and derogatory from his paſſion; therefore <hi>we pray not FOR him,</hi> as though he wanted our relief, but <hi>VNTO</hi> him rather, that he may aſſiſt vs with his charitable interceſſion.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>we pray for others;</hi> that is to ſay, for all them, of whoſe actuall felicity the Church hath not yet attayned a ſecure, and infallible perſwaſion; otherwiſe, if ſhe knew that
<pb facs="tcp:4278:99"/> they were in preſent poſſeſſion of ioy, it were as great as injury to pray for them alſo, as for the Martyrs themſelues, ſince the reaſon, why ſhe prayeth not for Martyrs, is, becauſe ſhe is confidently reſolued that they, being in heauen, ſtand not in any exigence of hir deuotion.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore, ſince the <hi>CATHOLICK</hi> Church prayed for other me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as not being in heauen (or not certainly know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to be there) ſhe did conceiue that they were, or might be (for ought ſhe knew to the contrary) in <hi>ſome third place,</hi> and conſequently <hi>in ſome temporall payn:</hi> and ſo (neceſſarily) ſhe did belieue, that there is a <hi>PVRGATORY</hi> after this <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> life. To contend about <hi>WORDS,</hi> and <hi>NAMES,</hi> it is a vanity; for it is ſufficient to haue a ſure apprehenſion of the <hi>THING</hi> it ſelf. To litigate about things <hi>ACCI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DENTALL,</hi> 
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> it is a folly; for it is inough to be certayn of the <hi>SVBSTANTIALL</hi> point: the reſt haue their probability in their ſeuerall degrees, and are permitted vnto <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> free diſpute. Finally; later ages may amplify, not alter the doctrine of the former; fayth hath an augmentation, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitt hir progreſſe, not innouation to chandge hir pureneſſe. <hi>IESVS proficiebat ſapientiâ,</hi>

The firſt prooceed in legitimate manner againſt the ſecond, by virtue of Canonicall, and Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall proceſſe. The ſecond proceed againſt the firſt by lawes temporall, and by Parliamentary decrees. The firſt proceed againſt the ſecond directly, and without circuitions, as guilty of <hi>ſchiſme,</hi> and <hi>hereſy;</hi> and to this effect they bring forth the ancient, and the moderne conſtitutions of ſacred Councells, Oecumenicall, Nationall, Prouinciall &amp;c. The ſecond proceed againſt the firſt really, and meerely for their Religion it ſelf, but vnder the name of <hi>treaſon,</hi> and <hi>diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,</hi> and ſuch like pretenſes. Which prepoſterous order of vniuſt iuſtice doth irrefutably conuince the Proteſtants of hereſy, and impiety againſt the Catholick faith. For, doth not euery man (indued with any meaſure of vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding) conceiue, that the Church of God (the pillar of truth) as it hath, and muſt preſerue the faith of our Lord <hi>Ieſus</hi> Chriſt, pure, and immaculate from the contagion of hereſy (or els there was no Catholick Church; and then there is no Chriſt, no God, no hell, no heauen, no immortality, no retribution) ſo it is, and was furniſhed, and ſtrengthened with proper lawes for the due correction of hereticks, and for the extirpation of their errours? I ſay, that to ſuppoſe the contrary, it is a ſenſeleſſe imagination; and to affirme the contrary, it were an Atheiſticall poſition. Reflect now, I pray you, vpon your owne Congregation, ſhe that hath inueſted hir ſelf with the glorious title of the CATHO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LICK Church, Where are hir ancient Eccleſiaſticall lawes, hir Canons, hir conſtitutions wherewith ſhe is armed, and aſſiſted to proceed againſt the <hi>Papists,</hi> whoſe hereſies you exclayme againſt with violence, ſupporting your mighty accuſations with ſlender proofes?

                        <p n="4">4. Wherefore, I pray you ſee the ſalue of a miſappled di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction, by which he ſeeketh to heale the wound of your incurable diſſenſion: ſaying; <q>the humane nature of Chriſt hath two kinds of being; the one NATVRALL, the other PERSONALL; the firſt limited, and finite, the ſecond infinite, and incomprehenſible. For, ſeeing the nature of a man is a created nature, and eſſence, it can not be but finite; and ſeeing it hath no perſonall ſubſiſtence of it owne, but that of the Sonne of God communicated vnto it, which is infinite, and without limitation, it can not be denied to haue an infinite ſubſiſtence, and to ſubſiſt in an incomprehenſible, and illimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſort, and conſequently euery where. Thus then the body of Chriſt <hi>ſecundum eſſe naturale</hi> is contayned in one place, but <hi>ſecundum eſſe perſonale</hi> may rightly be ſayd to be euery where.</q> So he; and then he glorieth of the facility to reconcile all the aſſertions of your Diuines touching this part of Chriſtian faith, <q>to ſtopp the mouths of your <hi>pratling aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries &amp;c.</hi> Truly the <hi>Geneuians</hi> themſelues (who excell in the art of <note n="*" place="margin">See <hi>D. Bancrofts</hi> Suruay; pag. 195.</note> reconciliation) may yeald the buckler vnto him.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p n="5">5. But yet he hath fayled exceedingly in two poynts, FIRST, in ſaying that <hi>there is no place, where the body of Christ is not vnited perſonally vnto that God, who is euery where;</hi> and that <hi>it doth ſubſist euery where &amp;c.</hi> For though the diuine Perſon, wherein the humane nature ſubſiſteth, be euery where, yet the humane nature ſubſiſteth therein finitely, and in one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate place; the vnion it ſelf being a created thing. You may take a familiar example to illuſtrate this poynt for your more exact comprehenſion thereof.<note place="margin">tota in ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, &amp; tota in qualibes parte. So the <hi>whole</hi> diuinity of Chriſt aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the humanity.</note> The ſoule of man is eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where in the body, and is not diuided in quantity, but hath different operations according to the diſpoſition of the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganicall parts, wherein, and whereby ſhe exerciſeth hir fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions. Now, though it be indiuiſibly in all the parts of man, (the head, and feete being vnited vnto the ſame ſoule) yet the head is not vnited vnto the ſoule in the feete, nor the feere vnto the ſoule in the head; howbeit ſhe is the ſame equally, &amp; impartibly in both. Likewiſe, the ſimilitude holdeth in this caſe. For the diuine Perſon is eſſentially preſent in all places alike, as much without heauen, as within; but yet to ſay,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:4278:122"/> that the body of Chriſt hath vnion with his perſon in all places, becauſe it is vnited vnto that, which filleth all places, it is an hereſy, which the Doctours falſehood hath caſt him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, as you may ſenſibly perceiue.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. The SECOND errour is notorious, viz. <hi>the humane nature of Christ may rightly be SAYD to be euery where, in aſmuch as it is vnited perſonally vnto that, which is euery where.</hi> For it is a knowen, &amp; infallible maxime in your ſchooles; that by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the perſonall vnion in Chriſt, the proprieties of the diuine nature are attributed vnto the Perſon <hi>in concrete viz, GOD,</hi> and <hi>MAN:</hi> not vnto the humane <note n="*" place="margin">quando <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

You muſt vnderſtand therefore, that when the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall had deliuered this generall propoſition, <hi>We ſee that</hi> ALL <hi>Churches diuided from this head did incontinently wither,</hi> he addeth this limitation in the wordes immediately following; <q>

                        </p>
                        <p n="14">14. The Cardinall ſpeaketh of <hi>Nationall,</hi> and (as I take it) of <hi>Prouinciall</hi> Councells; howbeit your Doctours Elderſhipp

Doctours ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular vntruth, I muſt confeſſe that I haue done him iniury, and will be ready to make any ſatisfaction, that he can reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably demand. Meane while, he muſt giue me leaue to detect an other of his excellent ſleights, and then I will referr him vnto his beſt thoughts. As it was a notable vanity in him to affirme, that YOV <hi>do willingly embrace the Catholick opinion in this article,</hi> ſo that is a delicate colluſion, which enſueth within the compaſſe of three lines: viz. à VOBIS &amp;c. <q>WE [in <hi>England</hi>] differ from YOV [Papiſts] concerning the <hi>place,</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which Chriſt deſcended. For WE ſay that he deſcended vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hell of the damned; but YOV ſay that he deſcended onely ad <hi>limbum Patrum,</hi> the region of the Fathers.</q>

                              <hi>num.</hi> 1.</note> ſee) why did he now pretermitt him, and ſelect an other? I will ſhew you the reaſon; for <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himſelf in the very next chapter, is of a contrary opinion vnto that, which M. Doctour deriueth
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:4278:138"/> generally vpon the Papiſts. What piety then, or humanity was in this prepoſterous deuiſe?</p>
                        <p n="5">5. Know you therefore, <hi>FIRST;</hi> that the opinion, which he here imputeth vnto VS without exception, is as falſely at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed vnto all <hi>Catholicks,</hi> as the other vnto YOVR <hi>Engliſh</hi> Church. <hi>SECONDLY;</hi> that your difference is in the ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall ſenſe, and meaning of this article; but our difference is a ſcholaſticall diſceptation in a matter of greater, or leſſer pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability, which, being a doubt not reſolued by the Church, may be indifferently accepted by hir children, without breach of charity, or violation of faith.</p>
